# Requirements Checklist

Legend: **Done** = implemented and evidenced; **Partial** = implemented with a stated caveat; **Manual** = code exists but needs a real environment/device; **Not done** = not implemented.

## A. Route data

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Preserve all 16 routes `01`–`08`, `10`–`17` | **Done** | `shared/routes.ts`; backend test “keeps exactly the supplied 16 route numbers” |
| A2 | Route `09` must remain absent and never be invented | **Done** | `TEMPU_ROUTE_NUMBERS`; tests for `০৯`, `09`, `route 09`; API rejects start with `09` (`400`) |
| A3 | Preserve exact stop names and order | **Done** | Structured source mirrors the supplied route strings; tests preserve special characters and parenthetical names |
| A4 | Preserve explicit return routes where supplied | **Done** | `return.stops` retained; Route 11 explicit return test |
| A5 | Handle `একই পথে` by reversing outbound | **Done** | `getDirectionData` reverse logic; test “routes marked একই পথে use the exact reverse stop order” |
| A6 | Route 15: `আবদুস সাত্তার রোড হয়ে একই পথে` without treating the road as a stop | **Done, caveat** | `return.via = ["আবদুস সাত্তার রোড"]`; return stops exclude it; test; **tail marked partially inferred** and needs owner confirmation |
| A7 | Keep `একে খান মোড়` and `একে খান গেট` distinct | **Done** | Different route-11 directions; search test asserts direction separation |
| A8 | Do not claim independent field verification of the dataset | **Done** | README, known limitations, UI “verified route” refers to the supplied dataset only |

## B. Driver journey flow

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | Flow: route → direction → valid partial start/end | **Done** | `DriverPanel.tsx`; start/end selects reset on route/direction change |
| B2 | Reject invalid journeys server-side | **Done** | `shared/journey.ts` + `parseStartRequest`; `INVALID_DIRECTION`, `INVALID_INDEX`, `SAME_STOP`, `END_BEFORE_START`, `UNKNOWN_ROUTE` |
| B3 | Do not accept same stop or reversed indices | **Done** | Journey tests; API `400` tests |
| B4 | Show the selected segment and route direction before start | **Done** | Driver route preview with matched stop chips and selected start → end |
| B5 | Warn when a direction is partially inferred | **Done** | “আংশিক অনুমান” badge and driver warning for Route 15 |

## C. Genuine GPS and consent

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Use only genuine browser/device GPS | **Done, caveat** | `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` + `watchPosition`; no sample coordinates or simulated movement. Browser GPS can still be spoofed by a determined user |
| C2 | Explicit consent before sharing | **Done** | Checkbox + consent text; server requires `consent === true`; test rejects missing consent |
| C3 | No fake movement or “demo vehicle” presented as live | **Done** | No seeded vehicles; empty map state; “No simulated or demo positions” copy |
| C4 | Clear permission-denied, unavailable, timeout states | **Done** | Driver error mapping and localized messages |
| C5 | Stop sending on stop, permission loss, session expiry, page hide | **Done** | `clearWatch`, `pagehide`, `stopTracking`, `UNAUTHORIZED_SESSION` handling |
| C6 | Do not show coordinates to the driver | **Done** | Driver UI shows only time, accuracy, session ID, expiry |
| C7 | Genuine two-device GPS test | **Manual** | Requires physical phone/tablet; not available here |

## D. Multi-vehicle tracking

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Support multiple vehicles without overwriting | **Done** | Per-session records keyed by token hash; two-vehicle API test |
| D2 | Session-identified updates | **Done** | Bearer token → SHA-256 hash → atomic update |
| D3 | Store only hashed tokens | **Done** | `generateSessionSecrets`, `hashSessionToken`; no raw token in DB |
| D4 | Use server timestamps | **Done** | `startedAt`, `lastLocationAt`, `expiresAt`, `serverTime`, `ageSeconds`; client clock not trusted for freshness |
| D5 | Validate coordinates and body size | **Done** | Latitude/longitude/accuracy checks; 16 KB JSON limit |
| D6 | Rate-limit updates | **Done** | Per-session min interval (`429 UPDATE_TOO_FREQUENT`) plus endpoint limits |
| D7 | Hide stale locations | **Done** | Server cutoff + client-side aging; tests for stale hiding and count |
| D8 | Filter by route | **Done** | `/api/tracking/active?routeNumber=`; map filter |
| D9 | Accessible textual vehicle list | **Done** | Live map list with route, direction, segment, age, accuracy, privacy label |

## E. MongoDB and persistence

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| F2 | Keep `MODEL_API_KEY` backend-only | **Done** | `server/config.ts`; no `VITE_*` secret; health hides key |
| F3 | Route-grounded answers only | **Done, caveat** | Prompt includes verified route context; output guard rejects unknown route numbers. Facts still need human review |

| G5 | Do not claim authentication/verification from phone/plate | **Done** | No phone/plate fields; repeated unverified banners |
