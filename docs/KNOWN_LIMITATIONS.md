# Known Limitations

This document lists what the prototype does **not** do or has not yet proven. It is intentionally blunt so the demo and submission do not overclaim.

## 1. Route data

- The 16-route dataset comes from the supplied hackathon route list. It has not been independently field-verified street by street.
- Route `09` is absent because the supplied dataset has no route 09. The app never invents it.
- **Route 15's return tail is partially inferred.** The source says `আবদুস সাত্তার রোড হয়ে একই পথে`. The app keeps `আবদুস সাত্তার রোড` as a via-road, keeps the explicit `কোতোয়ালী মোড় → লালদীঘি → আন্দরকিল্লা` prefix, and reverses the outbound suffix after that. Owner confirmation is still required.
- “Verified” in the UI means “matches the supplied structured dataset”, not “checked against an official transport authority”.
- Stop spellings are preserved from the source, including variants such as `মোড়`/`মোড়` and `পাড়া`/`পাড়া`. Search normalizes Unicode and digits, but other sources may spell names differently.
- The dataset has no fare, schedule, frequency, accessibility, or operator information.
- No geocoding is used. A place outside the supplied stop names will not be invented; search returns no result.

## 2. Driver identity and vehicle verification

- There is **no driver authentication**.
- There is **no phone verification**, plate verification, document upload, or background check.
- The route, direction, start/end stop, and consent are self-declared.
- Anyone who can reach the driver page can create a live session and declare a route.
- The UI labels this limitation in passenger and driver views.
- Adding real verification later requires a genuine provider and a careful review of impersonation, privacy, and data-retention risks. A phone number or plate photo alone would not prove identity.

## 3. GPS authenticity

- The app uses the browser/device Geolocation API. It does not generate sample coordinates or simulate movement.
- The server validates coordinate ranges, accuracy, update rate, consent, and session ownership.
- The server **cannot prove physical presence**. A determined user can spoof browser geolocation with developer tools, a modified browser, or a rooted device.
- GPS accuracy varies in dense urban areas, under bridges, and indoors. The app displays reported accuracy but does not guarantee it.
- There is no background tracking. Tracking stops when the driver leaves the driver view in the same tab, closes the page, or loses permission.
- On Android, the WebView must be granted location permission and the page must be in the foreground. The manifest has permissions, but the APK has not been built/tested here.
- No geofencing confirms that the driver is actually near the declared route.

## 4. Persistence and scale

- Without `MONGODB_URI`, the app runs in **explicit non-persistent memory mode**. A server restart removes all sessions.
- Memory mode is a single-process `Map`. It is not shared across multiple server instances, serverless functions, or horizontal replicas.
- `memory-fallback` is used when MongoDB is configured but unreachable and `MONGODB_REQUIRED=false`. It is still non-persistent and labelled in the UI.
- The MongoDB schema, indexes, TTL, and queries are implemented, but the real Atlas integration test was **skipped** because no `MONGODB_URI_TEST` was available.
- The TTL monitor is not instantaneous; expired sessions are filtered by queries immediately, but physical deletion can lag.
- The active list is capped at 100 vehicles. There is no pagination or clustering.
- No load test, capacity test, or multi-region test has been run.
- No backup/restore procedure is configured.

## 5. Meta AI

- The endpoint (`https://api.meta.ai/v1`) and model (`muse-spark-1.3`) were verified through an authenticated model listing.
- **No real inference call was made** during automated testing, because no approval to consume provider credits was given. Answer quality, latency, refusal behaviour, and cost are unverified.
- The prompt is grounded in the route dataset and aggregate live counts, and an output guard rejects unknown route numbers. That does not guarantee factual correctness, tone, or safety.
- The AI can be wrong about directions, stop order, or whether a route is suitable. It is an assistance layer, not an authority.
- Chittagonian (`ctg`) is **experimental**. The model may produce standard Bangla or an inconsistent mix; the UI says so. No native-speaker evaluation has been done.
- The AI receives the user's question text. Users should not type personal or sensitive information.
- The AI is rate-limited to 10 requests/minute per IP by default. Provider-side limits and billing can still change.
- `store: false` is a request flag; it is not a guarantee about provider-side retention. Review Meta's current terms before production.
- The assistant does not support images, voice, maps, turn-by-turn navigation, or live traffic.
- No conversation history is stored by this app.

## 6. Product scope

- No passenger accounts, login, saved trips, favourites, or notifications.
- No driver accounts or trip history.
- No fare calculation, payment, booking, seat reservation, or ETA.
- No demand insights. If added, they must be voluntary, aggregated, and privacy-preserving; no passenger location or individual trip history should be collected for them.
- No admin dashboard, moderation queue, or abuse reporting flow.
- No multi-language route-name translation; route and stop names remain Bangla.
- No offline map tiles. The map needs network access to OpenStreetMap.
- No native push notifications or background location.
- No iOS build/test.

## 7. Security and privacy

- No formal threat model, penetration test, or security audit.
- No static-host content security policy (CSP) is configured. Helmet covers API responses only.
- The frontend loads Google Fonts and OpenStreetMap tiles from third parties; those services see the viewer's IP and request metadata.
- The bearer session token is kept in JavaScript memory. XSS or a malicious extension could steal an active token.
- CORS is an allowlist, not authentication.
- Rate limits are per IP by default and can be bypassed with many IPs.
- There is no account-level ban, device binding, or revocation list beyond stop/expiry.
- No encryption is implemented at the application layer; TLS and Atlas encryption depend on deployment.
- No audit log of driver sessions; only aggregate request logs.
- No data-subject request workflow, privacy notice review, or lawful-basis analysis for a real deployment.
- The app does not collect passenger location, but the **driver's vehicle position is public** while live. That is a product privacy decision, not an accident.
- The map does not round coordinates.
- Server logs intentionally avoid bodies/tokens/coordinates, but hosting/proxy logs may differ.

## 8. Accessibility and UX

- Semantic HTML, labels, focus styles, skip link, live regions, and reduced-motion support are implemented.
- No screen-reader testing with NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver has been performed.
- Colour contrast has not been formally audited.
- The Leaflet map is not fully keyboard-navigable; the textual vehicle list is the accessible fallback.
- Bangla typography depends on Google Fonts in this build; if the font request fails, the system fallback may look different.
- The UI is responsive at common breakpoints but has not been tested on a wide device matrix.
- Very long route names or unusual text zoom may cause wrapping that was not visually reviewed.

## 9. Platform and deployment

- The Android project exists under `android/`, and location/internet permissions were added to `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- **The APK was not built.** Java was not found and `ANDROID_HOME` was not set in this environment.
- The WebView geolocation flow has not been device-tested.
- The frontend production build is verified, but no static host, API host, TLS certificate, reverse proxy, or Atlas cluster was provisioned.
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` must be set at build time for a separately hosted API. An empty value assumes the dev proxy.
- The backend runs TypeScript through `tsx`; there is no dedicated production compile/minify pipeline.
- No CI/CD pipeline, container image, infrastructure-as-code, or monitoring/alerting exists.
- No Git repository was initialized, and nothing was committed or pushed.
- No deployment or paid inference was performed without approval.

## 10. Hackathon and legal

- The public event page was found at `https://dev.meta.ai/events/global-hackathon`, but the official rules, waiver, eligibility criteria, submission format, judging rubric, and IP/ownership terms require login and have **not been confirmed**.
- Do not publish, license, or deploy until those terms are reviewed.
- No license file is included. Add one only after the IP terms are confirmed.
- The product name, branding, and route dataset ownership should be reviewed before a public launch.
- No user research, field trial, or transport-owner agreement has been completed.

## 11. Testing gaps

- Real Meta inference test: not run (cost approval).
- MongoDB Atlas integration test: skipped (no test URI).
- Two physical devices: not run.
- GPS denial/network-loss was exercised in headless Chrome with geolocation emulation and failed requests; a real phone test is still not run. Accuracy and background/battery behaviour remain untested on hardware.
- Android APK build/install: not run.
- Load, soak, and concurrency tests: not run.
- Security penetration test: not run.
- Cross-browser matrix: Chrome headless only.
- Screen-reader audit: not run.
- Production deployment smoke test: not run.

## 12. What would raise confidence most

1. Owner confirmation and field check of all 16 routes, especially Route 15's return.
2. A two-device field test with real GPS, permission denial, tunnel/network loss, and battery/background behaviour.
3. A test-only Atlas run of the MongoDB integration suite.
4. One approved real Meta inference test with a small question set and latency/cost measurement.
5. A static-host CSP, self-hosted fonts, and a reviewed tile-provider policy.
6. A load test with realistic concurrent drivers and map viewers.
7. A native Android build with foreground-only location behaviour and a device test.
8. Official hackathon rules review before submission.
